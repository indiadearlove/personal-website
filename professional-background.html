            <h4 class="blue">Exeter University, Computer Science and Maths</h4>
            <h4> 2013-2014</h4>
            <p class="bg-description">While I was only at university for a year, I still managed to get a lot out of it learning about the fundamentals of programming and computer systems; in addition, I took part in various clubs, from Ski Club to Maths Society. However, I decided that university was not for me as it was very theory based and I want to actually code, also I found that I was learning better on my own than from lectures so I decided to leave and go a different path.</p>

            <h4>2008-2013</h4>
            <p class="bg-description">King’s is where I took my GCSE’s and A-levels. For A-levels I took Maths, Further Maths and Physics receiving A*AB respectively. Every year I would do the British Maths Olympiad always achieving gold or silver, and in my last years I did both Sevenoaks Code-Breaking Challenge and Southampton University Cipher Challenge. Also, I always kept up with sports, playing everything from Hockey to Badminton.</p>

          <h4>Makers Academy, 2014-2015</h4>
          <p class="bg-description">MA is probably one of the hardest and best things I ever did; it is an intense coding course that really pushes you to your limits. This gave me a very solid foundation for coding which allowed me to get my first coding jobs.</p>
          <br>

          <h4>Coursea, Case Western Reserve University, 2015</h4>

It turned out to be a great stepping stone to my future goals, and helped me to figure out where I want to go.</p>

          <h4 class="blue">Responsive Web Design</h4>
          <h4>Skillcrush, 2015</h4>
          <p class="bg-description">People search online on their phone, and the numbers are only growing. After I realized this I knew it was essential to learn how to make beautiful web pages that are responsive to mobile phones and tablets, which is why I am currently taking this course.</p>
